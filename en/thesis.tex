\def\Abstract{%
In this thesis we aim to build algebraic models in computer using machine learning methods. We start with a set of axioms that describe functions and constants and use them to train neural networks approximating them. Every element is represented as a real vector, so that neural networks can operate on them. We also explore and compare different representations. Main focus in this thesis are groups. We build representations for cyclic (the simplest) and symmetric (the most complex) groups. Another part of this thesis is the aim to extend these built models by introducing new "algebraic" elements, not unlike the classic extension of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{2}]$.
